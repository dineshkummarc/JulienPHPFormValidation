h2. Who is it for?

It's a library for people like me who don't want/need to use a PHP framework.

h2. Usage

include it:

pre. include_once('validator.php');

instanciate it:

pre. $validator = new Validator(array(
  'first_name' => array(
    'human_name' => "First Name",
    'rules' => array('not_empty', array('min_length'=>2))
  ),
  'email' => array(
    'human_name' => "Email",
    'rules' => array('not_empty', array('format'=>'email'))
  )
));

put this where you want to display the errors:

pre. $validator->display_errors();

now to keep the user-entered values when people send the form, we need
this variable to be set:

pre. $fields = $validator->get_fields();

and in each fields, we call the value() method like so:

pre. <input type="text" name="first_name" <?php $fields['first_name']->value() ?> /></p>

For more details, look at form.php in the examples folder.

h2. Testing

To run the tests, you must include
"SimpleTest":http://www.simpletest.org in test/validator.php .
You'll probably also need to change the URL in the setUp method.
